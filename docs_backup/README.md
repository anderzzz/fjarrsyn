# Fjarrsyn and Agent-Based Modelling 
Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) is a means to investigate a system of interacting 
agents. Each agent can take actions. These actions are chosen independently by
each agent on basis of information and resources said agent has at the moment.
In particular the information can reflect outcomes of actions by other agents. 
Under these conditions, the system of agents evolves and macroscopic or 
system-wide patterns can emerge that are not simple reflections of the intentions
or actions of any single agent. ABM enables
the study and design of these emergent phenomena as complex functions of agent and
agent interaction properties.

Fjarrsyn is a library to perform ABM. The 
The agent in fjarrsyn is constrained with respect to its internal structure,
such that the logic connection between inputs, beliefs and actions can be
clearly defined, analyzed and compared. However, the functional constraints are
modest, therefore the agent in Fjarrsyn can model diverse types of agents (fish
in the sea, cars on the streets, corporations in a marketplace, evolving
predators and prey, warring states etc.). The definition of the agent is
therefore a key feature of Fjarrsyn.
