class Clause(object):
    '''Collection of multiple atomic verbs that can be executed in defined
    sequence under a meaningful semantic label. To the clause a binary test of
    a condition can be attached.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of the clause
    verb_phrase : list, optional
        A list of two-membered tuples. Each tuple defines the atomic verb and
        the associated phrase, see details in Notes. The order of the tuples
        defines the order the atomic verbs are executed
    condition : child of _AutoCondition, optional
        A child class of the _AutoCondition parent class, which defines a
        condition to evaluate with respect to an agent belief or resource after
        the execution of the atomic verbs. 

    Notes
    -----
    The clause is defined by a sequence of atomic verb-phrase pairs as well as
    a condition. A clause can be comprised of one of the two components as
    well. The verb-phrase pairs are semantically defined, such as

    [('sense', 'noise in surrounding'),('interpret', 'possible ongoing activity')]

    where the first member of each tuple must correspond to an atomic verb of
    the agent, and the second member of each tuple must correspond to a
    particular Sensor or Interpreter (in the above example) of the agent. Other
    verbs and organs can be employed, and longer sequences can be used.

    If only a condition should be checked, the verb-phrase sequence should be
    left unspecified.
