Fjarrsyn System Simulation
==========================

A simulation in ABM executes intentional and non-intentional dynamics
and propagates the modelled system. During the course of the simulation
properties of the system can be sampled and system-level properties
can be studied in the recorded data.

Simulations can take many forms. The agent system is designed without
any specific simulation method being used. Fjarrsyn however includes
a number of specific simulation method implementations for
convenience, though other methods can be developed.

The design of the specific simulation and sampling methods that are
available are described below. The description should also provide
a view into how custom simulation methods can be developed, though
specific details are deferred to subsequent sections.
