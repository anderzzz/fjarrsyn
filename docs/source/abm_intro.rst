==================================
Purpose of Agent-Based Modelling 
==================================
Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) is a means to investigate a system of interacting 
agents. Each agent can take actions. These actions are chosen independently by
each agent on basis of information and resources said agent has at any
given moment.
The information can reflect one or more properties of the
system the agent is part of. The properties of the system can in turn depend on
the accumulated outcomes of actions by other agents of the system.
 
Under these conditions, the system of agents evolves and macroscopic or 
system-wide patterns can emerge that are not straight-forward reflections of 
the intentions or actions of any single agent. ABM enables
the study and design of these emergent phenomena as complex functions of agent and
agent interaction properties.

Examples of Systems
-------------------

Examples of real-world systems that can be modelled with ABM include: 

* **Car traffic.** Each driver decides what actions to take on basis of an
  objective and incomplete information about the state of the roads, including
  what other drivers are choosing to do.

* **Housing market.** The buyers and sellers are agents in the market each 
  seeking to meet some objective in an environment of incomplete, possibly asymmetric,
  information about a given real-estate property as well as the intentions
  of other buyers and sellers in the market.

* **Evolution of predator and prey.** The agents are organisms that relate to each
  other through death and survival, where survival strategies can proliferate as
  agents mutate and procreate.

* **Geopolitics.** The agents are nations or political institutions with potentially
  conflicting objectives that each seek to exploit its information and resources
  in order to attain their respective objectives.

Emergence as the Object of Study
--------------------------------

Neither of the above examples have an all-knowing, omnipotent agent that decides the
actions of all agents. 

A housing market, for example, may have rules that constrain it,
but no single agent dictates all outcomes. Evolution through natural selection
is the archetypical system in which intricate and durable structure and 
function emerges without any single ruler that determines all. 

*Something from nothing* is what emergence of regularity in the absence of
an explicit instruction from above is called at times. That mechanism,
and agent and system conditions under which a mechanism
imply specific outcomes, are therefore objects of study suitable for ABM.

In Relation to Game Theory
--------------------------

ABM is related to *game theory*. The latter is a theory of strategy in an
environment of self-interested agents with potentially conflicting objectives.
The *Prisoner's Dilemma* is the best known outcome of a type of game
between two agents, where the optimal outcome for both self-interested and
rational agents eludes them. 

Game theory is by design built on very
simple agents and agent interactions. ABM enables diverse agents that are
internally complicated, engaged in a wide variety of interactions. ABM can
therefore be used to quantitatively explore more types of systems that
correspond better with the real-world of agents, information and 
intentional actions, while any specific game theoretical theorem can
be numerically explicated with ABM.

In Relation to Philosophy
-------------------------

The best way to conceptualize a human mind and how a human decides to take
some action to alter the external world are topics of philosophy. One 
philosophical model on this subject understands human action as an
outcome of said human's beliefs, desires and intentions, and how these
interact with an objective environment. This is at a high-level how
most ABMs conceptualize the agent.

In philosophy there is an enduring debate around *free will*, which especially
with a material understanding of the universe is greatly complicated.
In a strict sense one can challenge how distinct the human mind is
from the material universe, and in an extreme limit doubt the reality
of intentions and beliefs as things in themselves. 

The fact that ABM is built on models of beliefs, intentions and how these
(among other things) are formed within a distinct agent, does *not* 
imply that ABM stands and falls with the truth of a particular metaphysics.
Rather, it is the *intentional stance* that ABM is built on, that is, the
usefulness of the conceptualization of a section of the universe as being 
in possession of intentions as we understand how said section of
the universe acquires a particular order. If the ground truth of how said
order comes about is found in mechanical laws of nature and the trajectory
the universe started out on at the Big Bang, or in a God-given soul
and ethical reason, or some other way, is therefore immaterial to ABM. 

However, the exact division between what aspects
of a system under study is a property a given agent is in possession of,
or a property of the system and external laws of which the agent is
constrained by, does not have to be self-evident. That division will
be a choice of the person modelling a given system and should ideally
conform to useful conventions. This finer philosophical point 
informs how Fjarrsyn is formulated.
