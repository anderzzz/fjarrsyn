# Fjarrsyn and Agent-Based Modelling 
Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) deals with a system of interacting agents. An agent
can take certain actions. Actions are chosen on basis of information the agent
has, which can include partial information about an environment of other
agents. Under these conditions, macroscopic or system-wide patterns can emerge
without any single agent acting as a centralized system planner. ABM enables
the study and design of these emergent phenomena as a function of agent and
agent interaction properties.

Fjarrsyn is a library of functions that enables ABM with a model of the agent.
The agent in fjarrsyn is constrained with respect to its internal structure,
such that the logic connection between inputs, beliefs and actions can be
clearly defined, analyzed and compared. However, the functional constraints are
modest, therefore the agent in Fjarrsyn can model diverse types of agents (fish
in the sea, cars on the streets, corporations in a marketplace, evolving
predators and prey, warring states etc.). The definition of the agent is
therefore a key feature of Fjarrsyn.
